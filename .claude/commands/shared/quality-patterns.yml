# Quality Patterns — Severity & Validation

## Severity_Levels

```yaml
Severity_Levels:
  CRITICAL:
    Definition: "Data loss, security breach, production down"
    Response: "Immediate stop, alert, rollback"
    Examples: ["Delete prod data", "Expose secrets", "Force push main"]

  HIGH:
    Definition: "Build failure, test failure, deployment issues"
    Response: "Stop workflow, notify user, suggest fixes"
    Examples: ["Syntax error", "Permission denied", "Test failure"]

  MEDIUM:
    Definition: "Warning conditions, performance issues, code quality"
    Response: "Continue w/ warning, log for review"
    Examples: ["Slow operation", "Deprecated API", "Large file"]

  LOW:
    Definition: "Info messages, style violations, suggestions"
    Response: "Note in output, continue"
    Examples: ["Code style", "Optional update", "Performance tip"]
```

## Validation_Sequence

```yaml
Validation_Sequence:
  1_Ambiguity_Check:
    Detect: ["vague instructions", "missing targets", "unclear scope"]
    Actions: ["Request clarification", "Block if critical"]

  2_Security_Validation:
    Path: "No ../, absolute paths only"
    Secrets: "Scan for API keys, passwords, tokens"

  3_Dependency_Check:
    Tools: "Required CLI tools installed"
    Services: "External services accessible"

  4_State_Validation:
    Git: "Clean working tree for git ops"
    Files: "Target files exist & accessible"
```
